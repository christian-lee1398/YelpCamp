This is a full stack web app (MongoDB, Express, VanillaJS, Node) completed through Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. This was largely followed along and the vast majority of this code is not mine. All credit goes to Colt and his team of TA's.
Thank you Colt for the Bootcamp. Best teacher ever!
